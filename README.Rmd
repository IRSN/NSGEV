## NSGEV 

The **NSGEV** R package is devoted to some Non-Stationary 
Extreme Value models.

The main function of the package is `TVGEV` which creates an object
with class `"TVGEV"` representing a Time-Varying model with GEV
margins depending on the time. This kind of model is especially useful
to study *block maxima*, usually annual maxima. This kind of models
could be used with CRAN packages such as **extRemes**, yet **NSGEV**
makes it easier to cope with bases of functions. It also brings some
new things such as the profile likelihood confidence intervals on the
return levels or on the quantile of the maximum on an arbitrary
period.

## Example

In this example we use the annual maxima of the daily maximal
temperature (TX) in Dijon (France) provided as the `TXMax_Dijon` data
frame


```{r, DijonDat, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(NSGEV)
head(TXMax_Dijon)
```
Note that the warnings and messages will not be shown in this example.

A TVGEV model requires a date variable beginnings of the annual blocks


```{r Dijon0, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df <- within(TXMax_Dijon, Date <- as.Date(paste0(Year, "-01-01")))
fit0 <- TVGEV(data = df, response = "TXMax", date = "Date",
              loc = ~ 1)
coef(fit0)
autoplot(fit0)
```

We can fit a model with a linear time trend
	
```{r, Dijon1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
fit1 <- TVGEV(data = df, response = "TXMax", date = "Date",
              design = polynomX(date = Date, degree = 1),
              loc = ~ t1)
autoplot(fit1)
coef(fit1)

```

The `predict` method can be used to compute conditional return levels
corresponding to a given year, be it a past or future year

```{r, DijonPred, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pred <- predict(fit1)
autoplot(pred)
autoplot(predict(fit1, confint = "proflik", trace = 0))
autoplot(predict(fit1, newdate = "2040-01-01", confint = "proflik", trace = 0))
```

The default confidence intervals are obtained by using the "delta
method" but profile likelihood intervals can be otained as well.


Rather than considering the maximum on a specific block, one can
consider the maximum $M$ on a larger period as sometimes called a *design
life period*. The distribution of $M$ is then no longer a GEV 


```{r, DijonMax, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
date <- as.Date(paste0(2025:2040, "-01-01"))
qm <- quantMax(fit1, date = date, confint = "proflik", trace = 0)
autoplot(qm) + ggtitle("Quantile of the maximum on 2025-2040")
```

By changing the value of the `design` argument one can different use
basis functions such as splines with given knots.


## INSTALLATION 

### With the *remotes* package 

In an R session use

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(remotes)
install_github("IRSN/NSGEV", dependencies = TRUE)
```

This should install the package and make it ready to use.

Mind that by default this does not build the vignettes shipped with
the package (long-form documentation). To build the vignettes, use
instead

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install_github("IRSN/NSGEV", dependencies = TRUE, build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
The installation will then take more time but the vignettes will be
accessible from the help of the package (link above the "Help Pages"
section).

You can also select a specific branch or a specific commit by using
the suitable syntax for `install_github`. See the **remotes** package
documentation for more details.

### Precompiled versions

Precompiled versions of the package are available for some platforms
and can be downloaded by using the **Releases** link of the GitHub
Repository.  Use `NSGEV_x.y.z.tgz` for MacOS, `NSGEV_x.y.z.tgz` for
Windows and `NSGEV_x.y.z_R_x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz` for Linux
Ubuntu where `x`, `y` and `z` are the major, minor and patch numbers
of the package version.
