	* Changed 'plot.TVGEV' to render in black and white print.

	* Refactored code of 'profLik': easier to read and display
	information.

	* Added a better control of arguments passed through dots.

	* Added exact computation of Hessian for TVGEV models. Might be
	plugged in the estimation in the future.

	* Added bootstap inference on unconditional predictions.

	* Changed predict.TVGEV to improve the convergence of the
	constrained optimisation.

2017-06-13  yves  <deville.yves@alpestat.com>

	* Added the computation of the (exact) Hessian of the log-density
	and of the quantile for the GEV distribution.

2017-05-31  yves  <deville.yves@alpestat.com>

	* New classes "bts" and 'bfts" for results concerning TVGEV
	objects.

	* Many changes concerning methods for TVGEV objects or derived
	objects: quantiles, density, RL predictions, ...

	* Bug fixes and fine tuning for profile-likelihod (implementation
	of chain rule for TVGEV models).

	* New class "TVGEV" for Time-Varying objects. 

2016-12-23  yves  <deville.yves@alpestat.com>

	* Fixed bug: with a non-zero shape the 'rGEV' returned
	simulations from the GPD with the same parameters.

2016-09-19  yves  <deville.yves@alpestat.com>

	* Copied 'stats:::format_perc' to avoid importing a non-exported
	function.

2016-09-09  yves  <deville.yves@alpestat.com>
 
	* Fixed In as.NSGEV.fevd, the mimised negative log-lik was not
	attached to the object making the profile-likelihood impossible in
	'predict'.
