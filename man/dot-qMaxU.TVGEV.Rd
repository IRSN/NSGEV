\title{Upper Bound for the Quantile of the Random Maximum using a
    \code{"TVGEV"} object.}
\usage{
.qMaxU.TVGEV(theta, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{theta}{A numeric matrix containing the GEV "theta"
parameters with one line for each block \eqn{b} . It must have 3
columns corresponding to the GEV parameters \emph{location}
\eqn{\mu_b}, \emph{scale} \eqn{\sigma_b} and \emph{shape}
\eqn{\xi_b} is that order.}

\item{p}{A probability.}
}
\description{
Find an upper bound for the quantile of the random maximum over a
collection of blocks. The distribution function of the maximum is
the product of the marginal (GEV) distributions functions for the
blocks over which the maximum is defined. By selecting the largest
GEV shape, the largest scale and the largest location, we get a
GEV distribution which is larger in stochastic order than all the
marginal GEV distributions. We can take the bound as the quantile
of this GEV distribution corresponding to the probability
\eqn{p^{1/n^\star}}{p^(1/ nStar)}, where \eqn{n^\star}{nStar} is
the number of blocks.
