\title{Predict Method for \code{TVGEV} Objects.}
\usage{
\method{predict}{TVGEV}(object, newdate = NULL, period = NULL,
  level = 0.95, confintMethod = c("delta", "none", "boot", "proflik"),
  out = c("data.frame", "array"), biasCorrect = FALSE, trace = 1L, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object with S3 class \code{"TVGEV"}}

\item{newdate}{A vector with class \code{"Date"} ot that can be
coerced to this class.}

\item{period}{Numeric vector of periods expressed as multiple of
the block duration. Usually the block duration is one year and
a value 100 will correspond to a 100-year return level, i.e.
to the GEV quantile with probability 0.99.}

\item{level}{Numeric vector of confidence level(s).}

\item{confintMethod}{The method used to compute the confidence
intervals. See \bold{Details}.}

\item{out}{Type of output.}

\item{biasCorrect}{\code{Logical} used only when
\code{confintMethod} is \code{"boot"}. When \code{TRUE}, the
RLnamed \code{"Quantile"} is computed as the average of the RLs
obtained with the bootstraped parameters, and it will differ from
the RL computed with the estimated parameters in \code{object}.}

\item{trace}{Integer level of verbosity.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to \code{bs}.}
}
\value{
A data frame or an array with the RL and confidence limits
for each combination of \emph{date}, \emph{period} and
\emph{confidence level}. So when \code{confintMethod} is not
\code{"none"} the three values \code{Quant}, \code{L} and \code{U}
are given for each combination (the first not depending on the
confidence level). The data frame is in 'long' format, with

Predict method for \code{TVGEV} objects.

\details{
Compute the Return Levels (RLs) for different period and different
values of the time block, as well as Confidence Intervals (CIs)
qfor these. The results are not predictions in the usual
acceptance.  The CIs can be obtained by the usual delta method,
provided that the approximate covariance for the estimated
parameters is found in \code{object}. They also can be obtained by
bootstrap, using by default the bootstrap results embeded in
\code{object} if any. The bootstrap can be parametric or
non-parametric, see \code{\link{bs.TVGEV}}. Finally, the profile-
likelihood method can be used: the Confidence limits for a RL are
obtained by maximising and minimising this RL under the constraint
that the log-likelihood is greater than a suitable value. This
method avoids the usual re-parameterisation of the model which can
is tedious for the general form of model allowed in \code{TVGEV}.
}
\note{
Despite of its positive sounding name, the "bias correction"
can have a negative impact with some Extreme Value models as used
here, especially for non-parametric bootstap.

\section{Caution}{
 When \code{confintMethod} is set to
\code{"loglik"} the required computing time is huge because
several constrained optimisations are required. Since the marginal
distribution hence the RL vary only slowly in practice,
unnecesseary computing burden will result when many values of
\code{newdate} are used as it is the case by default.
