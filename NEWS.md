**NSGEV** Package News
===========================

# New in version 0.1.8

## Enhancements

- For a `TVGEV` object, the `negLogLikFun` function now optionally
  returns the hessian.
  
- New method `quantMax` for the `"TVGEV"` class.

- New methods `quantMaxFun` and `cdfMaxFun` for the `"TVGEV"`
  class.
  
- The vignettes of the **NSGEVVal** package are now included in
  **NSGEV**.  The require technical functions from **NSGEVVal** are
  now included in **NSGEV** as "internal" functions

## Technical changes (non user-visible)
 
- The NAMESPACE is now generated with **roxygen2**


# News in version 0.1.7

## Bug fixes

- The `TVGEV` function did not work when a constant location was
  specified along with a non-constant scale and/or shape.  Thanks to
  Jesper Ryd√©n.

# News in version 0.1.6

## Changes

- The GEV probability functions `dGEV`, `pGEV`, `qGEV` and `rGEV` have
  been moved (with some changes) to the **nieve** package, available
  both [on CRAN](N.R-project.org/package=nieve)
  and [on GitHub](https://github.com/yvesdeville/nieve/). So **NSGEV** 
  now imports these functions from ** nieve**. As a consequence the
  compiled code used by this functions has been discarded, making the
  package easier to install at least for Windows users.
