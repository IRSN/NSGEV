Welcome to the **NSGEV** package! The main function of the package is
`TVGEV` which creates an object with class `"TVGEV"` representing a
Time-Varying model with GEV margins. This kind of model is especially
useful to study block maxima, usually annual maxima. A popular use is
assessing the impact of global warming using series of annual maxima
of the daily maximal temperatures.

# INSTALLATION

This package needs compilation. Hence if you are using a MS Windows
system you need to have the Rtools installed in order to install
**NSGEV** from its sources.

The probability functions (density, distribution and quantile) are now
computed differently for small shape $\xi \approx 0$, using a Taylor
approximation at $\xi = 0$. These approximations are used when $|\xi|
< \epsilon$ where $\epsilon$ is can be chosen before compiling the
package.  We use a 2-nd order approximation for the function, a 1-st
order approximation for their gradient and a zero-order (constant)
approximation for the Hessian. This leads to very good approximations
that are smooth and consistent.

The computations required are quite tedious. We used
[Maxima](https://maxima.sourceforge.io/) to compute the derivatives
and their Taylor approximation, along with the LaTeX package
[maxiplot](https://maxima.sourceforge.io/contrib/maxiplot/maxiplot_en.pdf). However
the formulas given by Maxima need some work to make them usable in the
numeric computations (in C). We need to express the derivatives with a
small number of well-chosen auxiliary variables that are computed only
once.

This feature seems to be unique among the available R packages devoted
to extreme-value. Although very small values of $\xi$ are not
frequently used, it turns out that the exact derivatives are difficult
to evaluate for small $\xi$ which may have some consequences in
optimisations. This is especially the case for the 2-nd order
derivatives and for the quantile function.
