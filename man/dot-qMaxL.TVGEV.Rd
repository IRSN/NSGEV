\title{Upper Bound for the Quantile of the Random Maximum using a
    \code{"TVGEV"} object.}
\usage{
.qMaxL.TVGEV(theta, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{theta}{A numeric matrix containing the GEV "theta"
parameters with one line for each block \eqn{b} . It must have 3
columns corresponding to the GEV parameters \emph{location}
\eqn{\mu_b}, \emph{scale} \eqn{\sigma_b} and \emph{shape}
\eqn{\xi_b} is that order.}

\item{p}{A probability.}
}
\description{
Find a lower bound for the quantile of the random maximum over a
collection of blocks. The distribution function of the maximum is
the product of the marginal (GEV) distributions functions for the
blocks over which the maximum is defined. By selecting the
smallest GEV shape, the smallest scale and the smallest location,
we get a GEV distribution which is smaller in stochastic order
than all the marginal GEV distributions. We can take the bound as
the quantile of this GEV distribution corresponding to the
probability \eqn{p^{1/n^\star}}{p^(1/ nStar)}, where
\eqn{n^\star}{nStar} is the number of blocks.
